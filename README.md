------------------------------------

MEDIA DIRECTORY FILE ASSIST IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGES! This is a working release, however, bugs may still occur! Please let me know if you experience any issues!

------------------------------------

Media Directory File Assist is a lightweight, command line-esque program designed to help rename media files (specifically, TV Shows and Movies), so Plex can automatically update the meta data (show/movie cover art, ratings, descriptions, episode names, etc).

The program will guide you through the steps, but this READ ME can also be used as a guide to navigate with as you use the program.

- Once you open the program, you will be greeted to the main menu. Here, you will be able to select which option you want to run (choose between renaming a movie, or a season of TV shows)

- Choosing Option 1 will run you through the TV Episode process. Here, there are multiple choice you can make:
  + GENERAL RENAMING (responding "N" to "multi files"): The files in your specified folder will instantly change. 
  + MULTI EPISODE RENAMING: "Multi Episodes" are TV episodes that are joined together, for example, Episode 1 and 2 are in one.mp4 file.
  + If you declare "Y" to "multi episodes" you will be able to specify if all episodes are multi episodes for a fast rename, or specify how many "multi episodes" there are.
  + If, for example, there are 2 .mp4 files that are "multi" ("Episode 1, Episode 2" is one file, "Episode 8, Episode 9" is another), you will type "2" when you are asked "How many multi episodes?"
  + Next, you will have prompts to specify the episode numbers that are joined. In the above example, when asked "Which episodes are joined?", your input will go like this: 

    + (MDFA): "Which episodes are joined?"

(MDFA): "First Episode: "

(user): "1"

(MDFA): "Second Episode: "

(user): "2"	

(MDFA): "First Episode: "

(user): "8"

(MDFA): "Second Episode: "

(user): "9"		          

    + Your files will then be renamed as specified

- Choosing Option 2 will run you through the Movie process. This is a bit more simple than the TV Episode process, in the sense that, there is only one option with 2 prompts: specifying movie name, and year of release.

- *** DO NOT WORRY! If you ever make a mistake, you can always revert your changes by responding "Y" in the "Would you like to save your changes?" prompt ***
