Media Directory File Assist is a lightweight, command line-esque program designed to help rename media files (specifically, TV Shows and Movies), so Plex can automatically update the meta data (show/movie cover art, ratings, descriptions, episode names, etc).

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Windows 10

# Setup and Instructions

Setup is fairly simple, just run and you're set. Here's what you need to know:

Once you open the program, you will be greeted to the main menu. Here, you will be able to select which option you want to run (choose between renaming a season of a TV show, or a movie)

- Choosing Option 1 will run you through the TV Episode process. There are multiple choices you can make:
  + GENERAL RENAMING (a.k.a responding "N" to "multi files"): The files in your specified folder will instantly change. 
  + MULTI EPISODE RENAMING: "Multi Episodes" are TV episodes that are joined together, for example, Episode 1 and 2 are in one.mp4 file (ShowName-E01E02).
  + If you declare "Y" to "multi episodes" you will be able to specify if all episodes are multi episodes for a fast rename, or specify how many "multi episodes" there are.
  + If, for example, there are 2 .mp4 files that are "multi" ("Episode 1, Episode 2" is one file, "Episode 8, Episode 9" is another), you will type "2" when you are asked "How many multi episodes?"

- Choosing Option 2 will run you through the Movie process. This is a bit more simple than the TV Episode process, in the sense that, there is only one option with 2 prompts: specifying movie name, and year of release.

- If you ever make a mistake, you can always revert your changes by responding "Y" in the "Would you like to save your changes?" prompt
